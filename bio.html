                    Josh was born and raised in Framingham, MA. Growing up during the height of the Boston sports championship run, Josh quickly developed a passion for sports, and became an avid fan of all Boston sports teams.
                    He wasn't just a fan, but an athlete as well. Josh tried pretty much every sport there was as a child, but he fell in love with the game of hockey at a young age.
                    He was a goaltender and worked his way up through the ranks, eventually earning a Division I spot on the Quinnipiac University men's hockey team, and extended that to a short pro career in the minor leagues after.

                <p>
                    It was during his time at Quinnipiac where he began to develop a passion for software and data. Enrolled as a math major, he enjoyed finding patterns in numbers and many other different fields.
                    He quickly picked up a minor in computer science, and graduated from in 2021 Cum Laude.
                    He then continued his journey in 2023 by enrolling part time in Georgia Tech's Master of Analytics program, while working full time as a Solutions Consultant for Nuix.
                    At Nuix, he lead the development of the Nuix Graph Analytics product, and also helped customers create their own custom NLP models with Nuix NLP.

                    Josh graduated with his Master's degree from Georgia Tech in 2025, and then advanced his career to Accenture, where he is working as an AI Engineer.
                    Since joining Accenture, he has been working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with a Fortune 500 company, developing their customer support chatbot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    He currently lives in Boston, where he enjoys cooking, working out, and cheering on his beloved Boston sports teams.
